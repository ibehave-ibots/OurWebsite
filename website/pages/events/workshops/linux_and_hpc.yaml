description: >
  In this hands-on workshop, participants will explore the fundamentals of high-performance computing (HPC), 
  focusing on using HPC clusters, optimizing code for single-core performance, and leveraging parallel processing and GPUs.

  You'll start with the basics of Linux and bash scripting, and learn to navigate and manage resources on HPC systems. 
  The workshop will cover job scripting, resource estimation, and monitoring, as well as the workings of parallel file systems.

  Next, you'll dive into Python optimizations, profiling techniques, and memory/I/O management to overcome performance bottlenecks. 
  Finally, you'll explore parallel execution, both on multi-core CPUs and GPUs, and learn how to use tools like Numba for performance 
  improvements and understand algorithmic scaling.

  By combining these technologies and skills, participants will be equipped to maximize the efficiency and performance of their computational tasks, 
  making this workshop ideal for researchers and professionals in the field.
