description: >
  In this hands-on workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of collaborative 
  software development and computational reproducibility. Using Git, GitHub, and Zenodo, participants will 
  learn to update evolving code in a place they can share with others, both during development and after publication.
  The workshop also covers professional practices for software management in the scientific community, 
  including documentation with Markdown, software dependency management with Conda, and data dependency management with
  DVC.  Finally, we'll dive into methods for organizing and automating multi-step data pipelines using scripts and Snakemake.
  This combination of tools and practices ensures your work is consistent, well-documented, and easily shareable. 
  Suitable for participants of all skill levels and backgrounds.
