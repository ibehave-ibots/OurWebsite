##  Intro to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

Morning collaboration sessions see participants working in small teams, collaborating to learn new skills and share their perspectives in a diverse environment.

At the end of each session, interactive Jupyter notebooks that explore the tools introduced the day will be available for independent learning and review, with teachers available to answer questions. People of all skill levels, experiences, and backgrounds are welcome!
