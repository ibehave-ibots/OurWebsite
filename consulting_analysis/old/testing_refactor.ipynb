To make sure we have a good understanding of the implementation and practical aspects of the concepts discussed in the previous session\\n we implemented a simple, but complete, model building and training pipeline. This pipeline includes preparing the data and creating Pytorch dataloaders, building Pytorch models using the nn module, and training the model using stochastic gradient descent.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutcomes: \\nWe implemented the complete pipeline and managed to make it work (i.e. the model successfully trained) on a toy example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext steps:\\n Focus on the model building to create deep neural network models with Pytorch and explore different ways that these models can be created using the nn.Sequential module.\\n\\n\\n\\nTimeline:\\n Not specific, but in general the sooner the better\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers:\\n Leon Kremers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelevant links:\\n\\n\\nGitHub repo: Type: \\nShort Chat\\n\\n\\n\\nID:\\n CS081123-SC\\n\\n\\n\\nDate:\\n 08.11.2023\\n\\n\\n\\nScholar(s): \\nGinevra Contini\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelation to other sessions: \\nthis meeting is the initiating short chat for the following hands-on session(s):\\n\\nHands-on Session 1: CS081123-HO-01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopic:\\n Tracking multiple animals with DLC\\n\\n\\n\\nDescription:\\n We discussed the current behavior of DeepLabCut\\'s multi-animal pose tracking which assigns the same color from the colormap to all points of an individual animal.

Furthermore, this does not correspond to the same behavior of the single-animal labeling where the colormap is applied to different points on the skeleton.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext steps:\\n We planned on a single hands-on session to look into the GUI and config file and see if we can resolve the issue together.\\n\\n\\n\\nTimeline:\\n Unknown\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers:\\n Ginevra Contini Type: \\nHands-On Session\\n\\n\\n\\nID: \\nCS101023-HO-03\\n\\n\\n\\nDate: \\n20.11.2023 \\n\\n\\n\\nScholar(s): \\nLeon Kremers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelation to other sessions: \\nthis meeting is the third hands-on session for the Inception Loop consulting series containing the following related sessions:\\n\\nInitiating Short Chat: CS101023-SC\\n\\nHands-On Session 1: CS101023-HO-01\\n\\nHands-On Session 1: CS101023-HO-02\\n\\nHands-On Session 4: CS101023-HO-04\\n\\nHands-On Session 5: CS101023-HO-05\\n\\nHands-On Session 6: CS101023-HO-06\\n\\nHands-On Session 7: CS101023-HO-07\\n\\nHands-On Session 8: CS101023-HO-08\\n\\nHands-On Session 9: CS101023-HO-09\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopic:\\n Inception Loop pipeline with a focus on model building and training pipeline\\n\\n\\n\\nDescription:\\n Building on top of our progress from the last meeting we continued with the model building and training pi\\npeline.

We used the models from the Sensorium 2022 competition where they had two main tracks: Sensorium and Sensorium+. The S\\nensorium+ track contains models that use additional predictors (on top of the stimulus) to obtain better predictive models. Behavioral variables recorded during the experimental session are a common choice of additional predictors and have been shown to yi\\neld significant predictive power. Since Leon also has behavioral variables in his dataset having such models are quite relevant for his research. Therefore, in this session we focused on including behavioral variables as additional predictors to the model.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutcomes: \\nDiscussed and understood different ways that behavioral variables can be included as predictors and how it is done in the Sensorium+ base model, implemented the addition of behavioral variables as predictors, and reproduced the results from Sensorium+.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext steps:\\n With this session we concluded our exploration of the models for predicting neural responses to natural images.

While we resolved the issue of invalid loss values we faced in the last session, the model seems to have difficulty training (i.e. the loss does not decrease). \\nBased on this we discussed a way to measure dataset quality: oracle correlation. We then implemented a method to compute oracle correlation and observed that the data does not have a high quality which means we cannot really expect the model to train well.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutcomes: \\nApplied the model on the newly preprocessed dataset. Discussed and implemented oracle correlation as a data quality metric and observed that the data does not have a good quality based on this measure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext steps:\\n Leon will work on the data so that we get better oracle correlation and we’ll continue working on the data in our next session.\\n\\n\\n\\nTimeline:\\n Not specific, but in general the sooner the better\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers:\\n Leon Kremers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelevant links:\\n\\n\\nGitHub repo: Type: \\nShort Chat\\n\\n\\n\\nID: \\nCS140224-SC\\n\\n\\n\\nDate:\\n 14.02.2024\\n\\n\\n\\nScholar(s):\\n Martina Canova and Ogulcan Cingiler\\n\\n\\n\\nRelation to other sessions: \\nNone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopic:\\n Their experimental setup is not exactly working as expected. Mainly software freezes and data is not saved properly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDescription:\\n There is an Arena, where an Arduino controls optogenetics and valves that release gasses that are used as stimulation in the experiments. There is an Arduino script that con\\ntrols the LEDs, and the main experimental structure is controlled through MATLAB code. There is also a camera that records the experimental setup. The problem is, when a short experiment (around 1-2 minutes) is done every seventh or the camera recording fa\\nils. For longer experiments (5-10 minutes) this failure happens less frequently. One observation they have is that as the camera is recording, the size of the file increases and when the recording is finished the file size is about 100KB, instead of severa\\nl tens of megabytes. In addition, sometimes during logging, MATLAB freezes, while this is happening the valve pressure stays high, which shouldn\\'t happen. The only solution that could be found to prevent this is turning MATLAB off and turning it on again. \\n\\n\\n\\nNext steps:\\n To have an in person meeting and get a good understanding of the system and how it fails, and with that understanding come up with a plan to resolve the issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nTimeline:\\n Ideally to be solved in one or two months. \\n\\n\\n\\nUsers:\\n Martina and Utsab are working on the system, Martina being the main user.

The computer was disconnected from the internet, and through troubleshooting we found that it was runni\\nng an older version of OpenEphys, which didn’t have plugin supprot.  Once we did an update and installed a power spectrum plugin, we could see 50 Hz noise.  I made reccomendations to get in touch with Trace and see if he could help them reduce their noise.

Just to summarize (so I make sure I understand correctly), there is currently a challenge around getting some software to acquire all 10 cameras at full resolution and 60fps, an\\nd that it is clear that it isn\\'t a hardware issue because the company\\'s proprietary software seems to be doing it well on the same system.\\xa0To help track down this problem and learn more together, we agreed to set aside some time together in person to\\xa0troub\\nleshoot the system\\xa0for 3 morning\\xa0sessions!
