            <h2>Intro to Neuroscience Data Analysis with Matlab</h2>

<p>In this hands-on workshop, we will explore Matlab ecosystem, with applications to data analysis from the world of neuroscience.</p>

<p>Morning collaboration sessions see participants working in small teams, collaborating to learn new skills and share their perspectives in a diverse environment.</p>

<p>Afternoons are reserved for independent learning and review through interactive materials designed to reinforce the key concepts via problem-solving challenges. During this time, an open Zoom session will be available for questions and discussion.</p>

<p>You will learn the strengths of Matlab through the analysis of electrophysiology data from a behavioral experiment, as well as data visualisation techniques that can be applied to any dataset.</p>

<p>All sessions are held remotely via Zoom.</p>

<p>People of all skill levels, experiences, and backgrounds are welcome!</p>
