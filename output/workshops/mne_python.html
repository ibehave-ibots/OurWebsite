            <h2>Intro to (M)EEG Analysis with MNE-Python</h2>

<p>Do you have EEG or MEG data, and would like to use Python to analyze it?  Would you like to learn more about (M)EEG analysis, plus a little Python programming?  With over 150 researchers contributing to its open project, the rapidly-growing MNE-Python library is just the package to learn!  </p>

<p>In this hands-on workshop, led by a contributor to the MNE source code and an author of MNE-Connectivity (https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-connectivity) Thomas Binns, and offered in collaboration with the Charité, we’ll walk through the basics of EEG analysis with the MNE package.  From understanding how to load data into MNE’s data structures to doing spectral filtering, artifact rejection, and ERP analysis, the workshop is designed to help you get started in doing your analysis in Python.  We’ll even look at some impressive features of MNE, including inverse modeling to brain sources and connectivity analysis.</p>

<p>By the course's end, you’ll have an understanding of how to install and setup a Python environment with MNE and be able to write analysis notebooks on standard (M)EEG data.  And, who knows? Some requested features and discoveries during the course may appear in future versions of MNE and MNE-Connectivity!<br />
Intended Participants: This workshop is ideal for Neuroscience Researchers at any level (Masters, PhD Candidate, Postdoc, PI). No prior programming experience required.</p>

<p>Duration: 15 hrs over 2.5 days</p>
